per our table of retiring_titles, there are 29,414 Senior Engineers, 28,254 Senior Staff, 14,222 Engineers, 12,243 Staff, 4,502 Technique Leaders, 1,761 Assistant Engineers, and 2 Managers retiring. It looks like they lose senior engineers and staff the most by a large amount over other titles.

per our second table here, 1,549 employees are eligible for mentorship. 

## Summary

When we compare the numbers of retiring people and people who are eligiable for the mentorship, it looks like "silver tsunami' is close. There are not enough people to fill the roles. Expanding the eligibilty date for mentors may increase the amount of mentors which would help to train enough people to prevent silver tsunami.
